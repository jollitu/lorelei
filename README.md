This README will evolve along with Lorelei.

Lorelei is a German name referring to a "rock headland on the Rhine River".
Lorelei is also said to be the name of a beautiful siren who sat on the rock, luring sailors to their death
with her song.

(I chose the name because I originally thought it meant something else. Oops.)

Lorelei is a backend Java implementation of the extremely popular LoreKeeper, which is an
application that stores "masterlist" and user information for "closed species". Written in Laravel, I thought
it would be interesting to see a Java implementation of LK.

It should be noted that, while LoreKeeper is a full stack application, Lorelei is backend only.
It is intended to have a separate front end to keep design
concerns separate, not to mention I'm a backend engineer, not full stack.

Lorelei is in its early stages and is not open for PRs. Feel free to fork the code and do
what you want with it, but make sure to read LICENSE.txt first.
